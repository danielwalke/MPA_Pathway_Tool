    ----------
    The given kcat entries are changed so that the kcats are now ordered and associated for each organism and
    the searched metabolies. Using NCBI Taxonomy, the taxonomic distance of the kcat tnry organisms to the given
    organisms is calculated, and - until the highest taxonomic distance or the desired minimal kcat entry length is
    reached - the kcats from the taxonomically nearest organisms are added. If there is a protein database kcat,
