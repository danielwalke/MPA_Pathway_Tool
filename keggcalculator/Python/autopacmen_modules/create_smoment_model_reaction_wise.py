    Arguments
    ----------

    * model: cobra.Model ~ A cobra Model representation of the metabolic network. This model will
      be changed using cobrapy functions in order to add the proteomic constraints.
    * output_sbml_name: str ~ The base name of the created SBML.
    * project_folder: str ~ The folder in which the spreadsheets and JSONs with the model's supplemental
      data can be found.
    * project_name: str ~ The sMOMENTed model creation's name, which will be added at the beginning
      of the created SBML's name.
    * excluded_reactions: List[str] ~ A string list of reaction IDs (the 'reverse' and 'forward'
      name additions must not be added, i.e. for 'ACALD_forward' just 'ACALD' has to be given) to
      which no kcat shall be added. Typically used for gas exchange reactions such as 'CO2tex'.
    * type_of_default_kcat_selection: str ~ The type of selection of default kcat values. Can be "mean",
      "median" or "random". Is "median" by default.

    Output
    ----------
    An SBML in the given folder with the given name, which describes the given stoichiometric model
    enhanced by the protein constraint introduction with this function.
